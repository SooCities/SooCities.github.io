**Sant Andreu** is a district in the northern part of Barcelona with an industrial tradition. The area's prosperity originally came from agriculture, owing to the water that irrigated the land along the banks of the Rec Comtal as it made its way from Montcada to Barcelona. In the 19th century, following the establishment of the textile industry, the centre of Sant Andreu was home to some of the most important factories of the day, including Fabra i Coats, La Maquinista, Fabricaci√≥ Nacional de Colorants as well as a large number of smaller companies and workshops. In 1897, Sant Andreu was annexed by Barcelona along with other municipalities on the Barcelona plain, but to this day remains the former town with the strongest sense of identity. Sant Andreu nowadays is a modern and lively neighbourhood, with a growing population, new green spaces, a variety of community activities, preservation projects for heritage, and a modern take, understanding this heritage through culture, innovation and the encouragement of diversity. Idensitat has begun the groundwork in researching the area and initiating contact with local actors.
