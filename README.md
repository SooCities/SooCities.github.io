**SOUNDS OF OUR CITIES** is a European project of cultural cooperation based upon research and the transfer of knowledge among the spheres of art, technology and social space. It is led by the City of Roeselare, Idensitat, Dear Hunter and Aalborg Universitet. The project focuses on two local contexts (Krottegem in Roeselare and Sant Andreu in Barcelona), as a critical reflection upon cultural identity in relation to the concepts of community and silence.

The objective is to activate sound art ideas in order to create a story that, from contemporary reality, deals with the concept of "**silenced spaces**". Taking recall and memory as its point of departure, the project aims to offer a fictional landscape upon which to project various realities, while opening up debate upon current issues.

The project begun with an open call that offered a residence to 10 artists (5 to Roeselare and 5 in Barcelona). Selected projects were developed within each cityâ€™s social context as well as through a residence. Within the framework of SoOC, various mediation activities are taking place throughout the chosen locations, and two exhibitions are to be held in each city.
