* Introduction

Welcome to the ever-evolving, developer-led digital catalog of the Sound of our Cities project. One of the objectives of the project is technology transfer. AAU has made a template for showcasing the SooC sound works, and deployed the works online with a CC-License on [[https://github.com/][GitHub]]: a web-based platform for version control using =git=. You can think Github also as a social media for developers: users can collaborate on or adopt open-source projects, fork code, share ideas and more. Here, you can maintain, extend, augment your project after the SooC lifetime. It is also easy and free to set-up a GitHub account and host your own portfolio using [[http://thejackalofjavascript.com/github-pages-free-hosting/][GitHub-pages]].

Simple prerequisite for these are:

1. *Have a *[[https://github.com/][*/GitHub/*]] account.

2. *Have knowledge on how to use *[[http://thejackalofjavascript.com/git-and-github-for-beginners/][*/Git and GitHub/*]].

3. *Understand how *[[http://thejackalofjavascript.com/github-pages-free-hosting/][*/GitHub-pages/*]] work: Free hosting as well though this is not mandatory.
