In the case of Donia Jourabchi, because she was unable to travel to Barcelona, we decided to realise the residency remotely. So we took advantage of the possibilities granted by the internet, and we launched an online workshop combining off-site exercises with online group meetings in which every participant might share their knowledge and experience. 

The workshop was held on the 2nd, 9th and 16th. of December of 2020, with several one on one meetings in between. 

## Workshop with Donia Jourabchi
## Urban exploration: Sonic experience and physicality of sound 
**Situated sonic practice / Acoustic territoriality.**

The starting point of the workshop was to ask ourselves how we listen to a place, and what makes the experience of this place specific. Sound is a powerful tool that gives us a sense of place. Once a sound is located, it is experienced, it defines the space that we are listening to, as the moment in which it is taking place. Once captured it resonates with that place. The way we listen is composed of different levels of attention.  According to a certain situation, we will develop different modes of listening. That means that listening is context-dependent, and that it is an active participation of our attention. In this urban exploration, we focus on the mediation between sound, body and space as a dynamic filter of physical properties into specific sonic qualities. The sounds we can hear and the sounds we make, as well as the recorders, microphones and loudspeakers are in this case the means to articulate the effects of sound in space.

During this workshop, participants developed artwork that defined their own expression of site-specificity when exploring an abandoned place of their own choice in their own city. After an introduction that provided examples of situated approaches and practices in the field of sound, participants were asked to perform a series of experiments on site. They considered its social context and history, but also used the architecture in its current situation as an instrument and a condition for their sound explorations. Each work progressively merged into another during the process of the workshop. The idea here was to build up awareness in how we experience and understand particular places in our city that remain unused or silent. The collected materials, the sonic experiences play with different modes of sonic appropriation of these abandoned places.

Eleven participants were chosen in an open call, and a group of artists and social workers was created. The participants of the group are: Natalia Domínguez, Aleix Plademunt, Wingel Gilberto, Anna Recasens, Sofía Balbontín, Matthias Neumann, Sena Aydin, Yolanda de los Bueis, Jordina Roca, Christos Papasotiriou and Carolina de la Cajiga. During these three weeks they explored and experienced a sound relation between the space, the body, the presence and the technology for creating new sounds through experimentation. 

The workshop worked so well that the whole group and the artist, Donia, decided to continue working together towards the exhibition of Sound of Our Cities, with the objective of forming a sound collage as a collective outcome that links together contextual elements, thoughts and narratives. \ [**MORE INFO ABOUT THE WORKSHOP**](https://www.idensitat.net/en/current-projects/sounds-of-our-cities-3/1570-transound-workshop-2)

## Bio

Iranian, born in Brussels, sound explorer. Her main focus is the movement of sound, body and space. She develops experimental approaches towards a spatial practice of sound. Sonic states as a potential mechanism to connect the social to the physical space in order to reject aesthetic conformity. Questioning the place of the body in the lived environment , and  finding out ways to cultivate community with a shared and dynamic understanding of space and presence. She explores places and situations in order to activate unknown terrains in the sensorial common space by designing site specific strategies.
