# News from Home, after scan with changes
This project focuses on the memories contained within the urban environment of Sant Andreu, and to present these as "audio postcards".

When they travel with the 'News From Home' project  to any particular location, Anne and Luke are interested in exploring beyond or in the shadows of the iconic landmarks. They believe that it is there that they can find a richness of stories, worth providing a platform for. To achieve this, they use the term *soundmark* (used in soundscape studies) to refer to a community sound which is unique, or which possesses qualities that make it especially regarded or noticed by the people in that community.

For 20 days of their residency, Anne and Luke were interested in exploring what exactly Sant Andreu's soundmark is, and what the important components are of Barcelona's phonic identity as a city. This time due to the COVID situation, the city was much quieter than usual, therefore typical soundmarks of the cityscape were perhaps not as recognisable at that time. While usually bars and restaurants spill open into the streets, then the doors remained shut. With far less people on the street, their attention was brought to bear upon the sounds of traffic and animals (mainly birds) around them. With the reduction of sound in the city streets, it became harder for them to grasp exactly what the soundmarks that would define the place for them were.

At this point, the artists wondered whether instead they should have been looking for the soundmarks which defined that time, in this strange period of curfews and isolation. Within a matter of years, this moment would pass, and the soundmarks of that moment would be of cultural and historical significance and would merit preservation and protection.  Certainly they would speak to this moment in time, but would they be interesting in and of themselves - traffic and birds? Or what were they missing? 

They decided to focus for this project on their own observations on the daily routines and memories of Sant Andreu. To achieve this, they used several new approaches to make local connections at a safe distance.  There was space to experiment with new ideas and new possibilities. They started by defining the borders of the Sant Andreu district, and walked everyday for hours to get an overall impression of all of its seven neighbourhoods. At different times throughout the day, they made recordings of soundmarks that took their attention. Sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and disturbing. They named all these files according to particular locations and categorised them, building up a folder with different sounds in time and place. They wrote down daily notes to remember what they had heard and seen that day. Next to their observations, there was their online research, and through social media they made an open call to connect with the locals. They received great input from the locals, and with this information they built up a greater understanding of the sounds of the past. 

For the exhibition, their objective is to create sonic postcards. With the sounds they have recorded, they will create surreal soundscapes that are connected to certain themes/stories that they found interesting during their residency in Sant Andreu.
