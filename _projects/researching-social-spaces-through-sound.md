The project studies the impact of public transport infrastructure upon how a location evolves, how the innumerable rhythms of the city and the com­ munity itself impress themselves upon the reso­ nating spaces of their surroundings through being in motion.

Neon­lit, a symbol of urban space, of intercon­nectedness --­ the Subway sign. Present and not present, the rhythm of a city underground, the pulsating veins of the organism through which people pass day and night.
What happens when one intervenes and adapts a site by simply referring, using a marker of this net­ work that seems to be real, but which now is only symbolic? You can hear the trains, escalators, re­cursive patterns of automatic transportation, yet the search for an entrance remains pointless. But in this visual and auditory illusion between sym­bols, sounds, mimesis, the grand network, real disappointment, real chance becomes apparent.


##### Bio
The artist collective Dynamische Akustische Forschung (DAF - English: Dynamic Acoustic Research) is concerned with the fundamental criteria of digital art creation in the 21st century. Sound is of particular importance in this context; it becomes the carrier and medium of artistic practices. Several performances, such as at the Festival Of Future Nows 2 at Hamburger Bahnhof , Berlin, or at the Ultima Festival at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter , Oslo, reflect an independent and unconventional approach to contemporary art creation through non-hierarchical, collective strategies.
