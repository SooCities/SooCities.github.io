Donia Jourabchi was unable to travel to Barcelona, and the residency was realised remotely in the form of an online workshop combining off-site exercises with online group meetings, in which every participant might share their knowledge and experience. 

The starting point of the workshop was to ask ourselves how we listen to a place, and what makes the experience of this place specific. During this workshop, participants developed artwork that defined their own expression of site-specificity when exploring an abandoned place of their own choice in their own city. They considered its social context and history, but also used the architecture in its current situation as an instrument and a condition for their sound explorations. The idea here was to build up awareness in how we experience and understand particular places in our city that remain unused or silent. The collected materials, the sonic experiences play with different modes of sonic appropriation of these abandoned places.

Eleven participants were chosen in an open call, and a group of artists and social workers was created. During these three weeks they explored and experienced a sonic connection between space, the body, presence and the technology for creating new sounds through experimentation.

Questioning the place of the body in the lived environment , and  finding out ways to cultivate community with a shared and dynamic understanding of space and presence.
