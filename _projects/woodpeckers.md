A sound installation that uses the resonance of everyday objects as a means to evoke an emotional memory. With a robotic drum machine and sound-reactive lights, the artists focus upon stimulating the imagination in order to deduce the physicality of the source object, thus creating a sound experience that leads the audience to a voluntary state of 'sensory experimentation’.

The layout of a city defines its rhythm and composes its atmosphere, and therefore the artists are examining movement in the city, and the pathways which define this movement. Key morphological elements of the urban landscape are translated into sound. This process will help them create the baseline of the sound piece, defining its tempo and composition, and will also allow them to examine online content and videos produced within the area, analysing their background sound. 

**Bio**

In-Dialog Collective is composed of Tiffany Attali, Calin Segal, Codin Segal and Caterina Miralles Tagliabue. They are a young group of artists, architects and programmers, united by their desire to re-invent the world around them. Their work explores the use of algorithms and machines in creating experiences that augment or create social interactions. In-Dialog projects consist of playful environments or installations where people can express their creativity and engage in social exchange.
