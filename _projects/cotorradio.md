This project is based on research related to the sense of belonging. The aim is to create a podcast entitled CotorRadio – an idea that came from a concept developed by the artist around the cotorras (tropical birds surprisingly found living wild in European cities) – with an ensemble of sounds and voices from the neighbourhood. Raphael looks at these non-human creatures as a way of broadening the interpretations of human reality in a time when narratives of social and minority struggles are being co-opted and misinterpreted by the leading world-wide far right discourses.
