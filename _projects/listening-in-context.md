Using the simple idea of creating \'portraits\' of people listening to their city, \'Listening in Context\' investigates the intimate role sound plays in our perception and the connections we make to our surroundings through what we hear. The project involves setting up a simple interaction with the public in public space, to engage people in becoming focused 'listeners\'.

##### Bio
John Grzinich has worked since the early 1990s as an artist and cultural coordinator, using various practices which include and often combine sound moving image, site-specificity, and collaborative social structures. He has performed and exhibited in North/South America, Europe and Japan, and his compositions have been published by a host of international labels. The focus of his work in recent years has been to combine sound and listening practices with various media to challenge age-old anthropocentric perceptions of the world we inhabit.Â <http://maaheli.ee/main/>
