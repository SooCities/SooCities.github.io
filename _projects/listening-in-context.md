In this project, John uses creative methods for understanding and interpreting how everyday sounds and soundscapes function as triggers or inspiration for the imagination. In the context of Sounds of Our Cities, he summa­rises this in a few basic questions: What happens to our active childhood imaginations as we grow older? How do the sounds of Krottegem in Roe­selare contribute to how its people imagine their neighbourhood? And can this method be used as input for designers and planners of urban space?

The materials he gathers from these simple exer­cises will form the basis of his own creative res­ponse and output. Read the short report on the project at John's webpage <https://maaheli.ee/main/sounds-of-our-cities-roeselare-be/> and listen to the soundscapes he has recorded at Roe­selare.

##### Bio
John Grzinich has worked since the early 1990s as an artist and cultural coordinator, using various practices which include and often combine sound moving image, site-specificity, and collaborative social structures. He has performed and exhibited in North/South America, Europe and Japan, and his compositions have been published by a host of international labels. The focus of his work in recent years has been to combine sound and listening practices with various media to challenge age-old anthropocentric perceptions of the world we inhabit.
