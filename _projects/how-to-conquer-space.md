A collection of stories and anecdotes, taken from public spaces or gardens, broadly related to seve­ ral of the artist’s research interests. Com conque­ rir l’espai (How to Conquer Space) has many layers to be explored, and many areas of study; the diffi­ culty of feeling at home in a new environment, the connection between two separate worlds or pla­ ces, the revision of official narratives, a critical re­ flection on intimate spaces, among other themes.

Madaula’s point of departure is the bouquet of flowers that his father first collected during the pandemic lockdown, when one of his few reasons to leave home was to water the vegetables in an urban allotment.That bouquet became his only witness that there was life out there. With this
project, Madaula intends to connect this point of interest to the first flowers that were grown in outer space (the orange Zinnias) inside a spaces­ hip, where plants and gardens will play a promi­ nent role in alleviating the harshness of living in such a limited and claustrophobic space. Thus, Madaula attempts to explore how these two ideas connect and relate to Roeselare’s green spaces, the inhabitants who care for them, and their stories.

Students from the master’s degree course in Sound Art (UB) hosted by Josep Cerdà, Josep Ma­ nuel Berenguer and Antonio Alcalde, the master’s degree course in Research in Art and Design (Eina­ UAB), and the Creation Workshop course, part of the degree in Fine Arts (UB), participated in the Voices project (part of the curatorial research).
