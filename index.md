SOUNDS OF OUR CITIES is a European project of cultural cooperation based upon research and the transfer of knowledge among the spheres of art, technology and social space. It is led by the City of Roeselare, Idensitat, Dear Hunter and Aalborg Universitet. The project focuses on two local contexts (Krottegem in Roeselare and Sant Andreu in Barcelona), as a critical reflection upon cultural identity in relation to the concepts of community and silence.

The project begun with an open call that offered a residence to 10 artists (5 to Roeselare and 5 in Barcelona). Selected projects were developed within each city’s social context as well as through a residence. Within the framework of SoOC, various mediation activities are taking place throughout the chosen locations, and two exhibitions are to be held in each city.

DEAR HUNTER was in charge of drawing up carto­pological maps in each of the selected areas, a group of students from Aalborg University designed this website and a digital application for mobile de­vices. Through augmented reality and sound, they experimented with forming connections between locations, personal experiences and art­istic projects. Idensitat curated the artistic pro­jects in the two cities, collaborating with Impact and the City of Roeselare, who were also in charge of the residencies in Roeselare, in addition to the exhibitions and the activations. The phyical exhibitions took place at 

- ROESELARE 22-30.10.21 (O.L. Vrouwemarkt, 30 )
- BARCELONA 11-21.11.21 (Gran de Sant Andreu, 111)

For both exhibitions, each artist has presented a work related to a location, in order to amplify that location, and/or to generate a new place wi­thin it, one which lets us imagine for ourselves experiences that the architecture itself retains in its memory, experiences which are not visible at first sight. An opportunity to imagine the utopian or dystopian using elements of memory, in which sound, in surprising ways, generates a new image of locations which are both well­-known and, at the same time, hidden.
