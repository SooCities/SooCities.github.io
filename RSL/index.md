Krottegem is a popular neighbourhood in **Roeselare**, situated in the east side of the city next to the railway station. The City of Roeselare decided to develop a plan of action called “Krachtgebied Krottegem” (Impulse Krottegem).  Roeselare intends to approach the challenges in a positive way using the power of the neighbourhood, including inhabitants, local businesses and associations. For a few years local people have been taking initiatives to improve daily life in the neighbourhood. Initiatives were also taken to enhance the look and feel of the neighbourhood, organising cultural activities and community driven initiatives. From the City of Roeselare the idea of “The Sound of our Cities” as an art exhibition / festival fits into the Krottegem neighbourhood regeneration process. That this kind of activity can improve the image of the neighbourhood and the city in the wider region, and offers the possibility to attract new activities, investments and (creative) entrepreneurship.
