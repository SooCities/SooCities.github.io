# Krottegem, Roeselare
Krottegem is a popular neighbourhood in **Roeselare**, situated in the east side of the city next to the railway station. The City of Roeselare decided to develop a plan of action called “Krachtgebied Krottegem” (Impulse Krottegem).  Roeselare intends to approach the challenges in a positive way using the power of the neighbourhood, including inhabitants, local businesses and associations. For a few years local people have been taking initiatives to improve daily life in the neighbourhood. Initiatives were also taken to enhance the look and feel of the neighbourhood, organising cultural activities and community driven initiatives. From the City of Roeselare the idea of “The Sound of our Cities” as an art exhibition / festival fits into the Krottegem neighbourhood regeneration process. That this kind of activity can improve the image of the neighbourhood and the city in the wider region, and offers the possibility to attract new activities, investments and (creative) entrepreneurship.

## Martí Madaula Esquirol - How to conquer space

Focuses on collecting stories and anecdotes from public space or its
buildings that relate, in a broad sense, to some of the artist's
research interests. This does not mean that the project will necessarily
be related to spaces as such, since How to conquer space has many layers
and, therefore, many areas of study may be explored, such as the
difficulty of feeling at home in a new context, the connection between
two separate worlds or places, the revision of official narratives, a
critical reflection on intimate spaces, among other issues, taking this
research as a starting point. One of the outcomes expected from this
residency is the production of a sound piece.

**Bio**\
Martí Madaula Esquirol, holds a degree in Fine Arts from the University
of Barcelona and a Master of Visual Arts from LUCA School of Arts in
Ghent, Belgium. He is currently working on the publication of his master
thesis, thanks to the Sala d\'Art Jove 2020 Creation Grant and the
support of the Centre d\'Art La Panera. His latest projects have been
presented in the art event Stronger than air, thinner than ice (2019) at
the UGent Observatorium, and in the performance How to conquer space
(2019) at Kolder-Gent, with Roos Nieboer.

## Banu Çiçek Tülü - The minor sonic cartography and the safe space

This project is a guided soundwalk which sets up a critical reflection upon the exclusivity of use of pavements, and how walking upon them can be an act of privilege.\ Walking, such an easy act in everyday life in the city, can be difficult, challenging, uncomfortable, and maybe impossible for certain communities such as women, LGBTQI, minorities, migrants, people with disabilities etc. Pavements can draw attention to the sonic violence (and many other urban problems through listening) that most of the above-mentioned groups confront, such as, cat-calling, sniping, swearing, and verbal harassment, as well as sounding car horns aggressively, and gunning the engines of cars of the roads. Therefore, this project aims to collect the sonic memories of specific groups of citizens, and return these memories to urban space in order to create awareness of a very common issue in our cities.

**Bio**\

Banu Çiçek is an artist, researcher and DJ with a background in urban design, born in South-East Turkey, and now based in Berlin. Her academic and artistic interests include participation, public space, sonic environment, acoustic ecology, collective listening, environmental spatial justice, urban activism, intersectional feminism, and interdisciplinary methodologies. She is currently a PhD candidate at Hamburg Fine Arts University, and is in receipt of a grant from the Heinrich Böll Foundation. She is a lecturer at the Humboldt University, Berlin.

## John Grzinich - Listening in context

height="150"}

Using the simple idea of creating \'portraits\' of people listening to their city, \'Listening in Context\' investigates the intimate role sound plays in our perception and the connections we make to our surroundings through what we hear. The project involves setting up a simple interaction with the public in public space, to engage people in becoming focused 'listeners\'.

**Bio** \

John Grzinich has worked since the early 1990s as an artist and cultural coordinator, using various practices which include and often combine sound moving image, site-specificity, and collaborative social structures. He has performed and exhibited in North/South America, Europe and Japan, and his compositions have been published by a host of international labels. The focus of his work in recent years has been to combine sound and listening practices with various media to challenge age-old anthropocentric perceptions of the world we inhabit. <http://maaheli.ee/main/>

## DAF (Dynamische Akustische Forschung)- Researching social spaces through sound

How does sound map the historical memory of a place? Sound reflects the relief of social realities: The innumerable rhythms of a city and the community itself push themselves acoustically into the resonating spaces of their surroundings. This project aims to research what a family, an apartment house, a factory building or a street sound like. The auditory information of a city overlaps to a rhythm which, at the level of hearing, integrates a million different cities in a single city at the same time, and accompanies audiences without a break. Within this context, an acoustic map of places will be created. This sound archive of a city is not intended to illustrate reality, but the continuous reformulation of its characteristics. 

**Bio**\

The artist collective Dynamische Akustische Forschung (DAF - English: Dynamic Acoustic Research) is concerned with the fundamental criteria of digital art creation in the 21st century. Sound is of particular importance in this context; it becomes the carrier and medium of artistic practices. Several performances, such as at the Festival Of Future Nows 2 at Hamburger Bahnhof , Berlin, or at the Ultima Festival at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter , Oslo, reflect an independent and unconventional approach to contemporary art creation through non-hierarchical, collective strategies.

## Marta Azparren & Pablo Martín Jones - Manoeuvres

![maniobras](https://www.idensitat.net/images/ID_PROJECTES_EUROPEUS/SOOC_2019_2021/maniobras_01.jpg){width="32%"
height="177"}

Manoeuvres is an artistic project, site-specific, that intervenes in old urban industrial spaces through image and sound. The artists will "listen" to the space of the old factories, and reclaim the story of the productive masses. It is not a nostalgic action, or a revision of past times, it is about inserting temporality, incorporating the past as one more layer to the collective story. The aim is to print the memory imprint of work in the white cube of the artistic space, and to question its neutrality during the process.

**Bio**\

Marta Azparren is a visual artist and performer based in Barcelona. Her videos have been screened and awarded in numerous international film and video festivals, exhibitions and art fairs. Her work claims to be a meta-reflection on the artistic activity, with special attention to the connections between creator, spectator and object, and its mediators.  Pablo Martin Jones is the son of a flamenco guitarist and a flamenco dancer, both Americans living in Spain. His approach broadened as he grew musically, and he developed a wider palette of sounds, that includes practically anything, while simultaneously immersing himself in electronic music. During this time he has performed with many great artists from many different fields, in many different styles and is increasingly in demand as a composer for film, dance and other performing arts.
