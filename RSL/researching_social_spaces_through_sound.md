How does sound map the historical memory of a place? Sound reflects the relief of social realities: The innumerable rhythms of a city and the community itself push themselves acoustically into the resonating spaces of their surroundings. This project aims to research what a family, an apartment house, a factory building or a street sound like. The auditory information of a city overlaps to a rhythm which, at the level of hearing, integrates a million different cities in a single city at the same time, and accompanies audiences without a break. Within this context, an acoustic map of places will be created. This sound archive of a city is not intended to illustrate reality, but the continuous reformulation of its characteristics.Â 

**Bio**\

The artist collective Dynamische Akustische Forschung (DAF - English: Dynamic Acoustic Research) is concerned with the fundamental criteria of digital art creation in the 21st century. Sound is of particular importance in this context; it becomes the carrier and medium of artistic practices. Several performances, such as at the Festival Of Future Nows 2 at Hamburger Bahnhof , Berlin, or at the Ultima Festival at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter , Oslo, reflect an independent and unconventional approach to contemporary art creation through non-hierarchical, collective strategies.
